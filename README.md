Blind chess set for Jin
=======================

This is a chess set to support blindfold chess playing for the Jin chess client [www.jinchess.com/]. The blind.zip file needs to be put into the `resources/pieces` subfolder of the jin installation. Typically the absolute path would be `/usr/share/jin/resource/pieces` after which a new chess piece set called *blind* becomes avaibable.
