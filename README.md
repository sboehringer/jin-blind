Blind chess set for Jin
=======================

This is a chess set to support blindfold chess playing for the [Jin chess client](http://www.jinchess.com "Jin chess client"). The blind.zip file needs to be put into the `resources/pieces` subfolder of the jin installation. Typically the absolute path would be `/usr/share/jin/resource/pieces` after which a new chess piece set called *blind* becomes avaibable.

Blindfold chess
---------------
Blindfold chess can be played at several levels.

  * Bord, piece positions available
  * Empty board
  * Closed eyes/no empty board for reference

The above levels are in increasing difficulty. This chess set supports the first level by showing the same symbol (circle) for every piece.

### Acknoledgements

This piece set is based on the `spatial` piece set by Maurizio Monge.
